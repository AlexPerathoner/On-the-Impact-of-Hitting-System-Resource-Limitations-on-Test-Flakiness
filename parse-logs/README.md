# Parse logs / stats

Calculate **average** and **max resource usage** for each test case, and its **flakiness**.

Used in this [figshare project](https://figshare.com/projects/Flakiness_in_MacOS_XCTest_Testing_Framework_and_GitHub_Action_Runners_Resource_Usage_Impact/172119).

## Input
- `logs.log`, downloaded from GitHub Actions workflow run (exported raw logs)
- `raw-stats.json`, downloaded from GitHub Actions workflow run (workflow run artifacts) - generated by [Telemetry action](https://github.com/AlexPerathoner/workflow-telemetry-action)

## Running
`npm run build; npm run run`

## Output
- `aggregated-stats-<timestamp>.json`, contains a json object mapping each test case to its:
    - average and max resource usage
    - flakiness
